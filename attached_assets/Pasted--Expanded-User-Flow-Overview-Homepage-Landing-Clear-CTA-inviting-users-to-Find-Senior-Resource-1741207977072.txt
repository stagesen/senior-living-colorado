üîπ Detailed Backend Data Flow & Tech Implementation
‚öôÔ∏è State Management (React/Vite + shadcn/ui)
Example using React‚Äôs useState() hook for managing state:

tsx
Copy
Edit
const [formState, setFormState] = useState({
  category: '',
  location: '',
  recipient: '',
  needs: [],
  notes: ''
});
Each dropdown or checkbox updates formState.

‚öôÔ∏è Dynamic Supabase Queries
Example pseudo-query based on selections:

javascript
Copy
Edit
// Example: user chooses Health & Wellness in Arvada area, with Memory Care & Rehab
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('senior_resources')
  .select('*, reviews(*), photos(*)')
  .eq('category', formState.category)
  .eq('region', formState.location)
  .contains('tags', formState.needs); // tags stored as JSON array
Tags:
Store service types as tags (jsonb) in Supabase, for efficient filtering.

json
Copy
Edit
tags: ["memory care", "rehabilitation", "physical therapy"]
‚öôÔ∏è Integrating Apify (External Reviews & Photos)
Use Apify to periodically update your Supabase tables:

Reviews and ratings from Yelp, Google Maps, or specialized senior care websites.
Photos and details from public listings or websites.
Apify ‚Üí Supabase (Serverless or Scheduled Job):

Apify runs scheduled scrapes.
New data gets upserted into Supabase via REST API or serverless functions.
Your front-end app queries Supabase directly; no real-time user Apify API calls.
‚öôÔ∏è Result Display (Tailwind + shadcn/ui)
Present results as clearly structured cards or table rows, e.g.:

tsx
Copy
Edit
<Card className="p-4 rounded-xl shadow-lg">
  <CardHeader>
    <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Arvada Senior Transport Services</h2>
    <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ (32 reviews)</p>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    <img src={photoUrlFromApify} alt="service photo" className="w-full h-48 object-cover rounded-lg mb-4"/>

  </CardContent>
