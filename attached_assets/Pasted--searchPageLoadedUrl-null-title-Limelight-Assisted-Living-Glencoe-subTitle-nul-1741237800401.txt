      "text": "My daughter works at Rocky Mountain Assisted Living and I have volunteered at the Glencoe home many times. I wouldn’t hesitate to have a loved one live at this or any of RMAL homes. The homes are built with real quality and also keep in mind the need for individuals who live there to have the sense that they are a “family” and live in community together. For this reason especially, I like the way RMAL homes are designed. There is a genuine feel of connection yet also some autonomy for each person to have their own private space. The outside deck space is especially comfortable and provides a lovely outdoor sitting space and eating area for our beautiful Colorado weather. I have interacted with the residents of the Glencoe home and the staff and everyone has been happy, well adjusted and well cared for and cherished.",

My mom's symptoms were a major cause of her passing and they did not bother making sure she followed up with Dr Jonathan Peterson at Innovage.  Then the owner went back and readjusted the dead mothers rent payments from $1543 per month to 1800 per month.  Not only that, she shared a room and her clothes were left hanging on the floor because the rod was unable to be moved up.  My mom was left in the shower for 1 1/2 hours before her roommate had to get on the house manager to go get her.  Most of the people were nice, but the experience to know when to call and follow up with the Dr was not there. I stand behind my review because I saw first-hand all issues.",
