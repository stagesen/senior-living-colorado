Distinctive Stylistic Elements

Depth through layering: Subtle overlapping of UI elements
Asymmetrical balance: Not rigid grid layouts, but thoughtfully placed elements
Breathing room: Generous whitespace that creates an airy, premium feel
Minimalist approach: Only essential UI elements, no unnecessary decorations
Subtle animations: Smooth transitions between states (0.2-0.3s duration)
